Here's mostly my Blueprint DEV Stuff, because I need it to be on reddit to be actually ready for HA.
Most of this stuff is "vibe coding". Using AI to actually learn how to develop and analyse for Home Assistant.

So don't take these as working, I'll publish them if they work on the official forums...
